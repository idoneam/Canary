        Perform a DnD-style diceroll
        [r]d[s][+m] ['each']    Rolls an [s]-sided die [r] times, with modifier
                                [+-m]. If 'each' is specified, applies modifier
                                to each roll rather than the sum of all rolls.
                                All parameters are optional.
                                Defaults to rolling one 20-sided die.

                                Dice can have 1 to 100 sides
                                Rolls 1 to 10000 dice at once
                                Modifier can be any int between -100 and +100
          Examples:
           roll             rolls a d20
           roll d6          rolls one 6-sided die
           roll 3d          rolls 3 20-sided dice
           roll 5d12-4      rolls 5 12-sided dice, subtracting 4 from the total
           roll 5d+3 each   rolls 5 20-sided dice, adding 3 to each roll
