| **Dev** | [![Dev Dependencies](https://github.com/idoneam/Canary/workflows/Dev%20Dependencies/badge.svg?branch=dev)](https://github.com/idoneam/Canary/actions?query=workflow%3A%22Dev+Dependencies%22+branch%3Adev)  |

## Installation

1. If you wish to use the `update` command to update to the latest version of the bot, configure your github account in
your environment of choice and clone into the repository with:
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/idoneam/Canary
```

2. Dependencies are managed with poetry which can be installed via pip with:
```bash
$ python3 -m pip install poetry
```

3. Dependencies may be installed using poetry with the following command:
```bash
$ poetry install --no-dev
```

4. Use of the LaTeX equation functionality requires a working LaTeX installation (at the very minimum, `latex` and `dvipng` must be present). The easiest way to do this is to install TeX Live (usually possible through your distro's package manager, or through TeX Live's own facilities for the latest version). See the [TeX Live site](https://tug.org/texlive/) for more information.

5. Development dependencies (YAPF and `pytest`) can be installed alongside all other dependencies with:
```bash
$ poetry install
```

6. You may enter the virtual environment generated by the pipenv installation with: `$ poetry shell` or simply run the bot with `$ poetry run python3 Main.py`

7. In order to run bots on Discord, you need to [create a bot account](https://github.com/reactiflux/discord-irc/wiki/Creating-a-discord-bot-&-getting-a-token).

8. In the Discord Developer Portal, you must enable the "Presence" and "Server Members" Privileged Gateway Intents (In the Bot tab of your application)

You must set certain values in the `config.ini` file, in particular your Discord bot token (which you get in the previous link) and the values in the `[Server]` section.

Logging messages from the level selected *and* from more severe levels will be sent to your logging file. For example, setting the level to `info` also sends logs from `warning`, `error` and `critical`, but not  from `debug`.

    * `DevLogWebhookID`: Optional. If the ID of a webhook is input (and it's token below), logs destined for devs will also be sent to it. These values are contained in the discord webhook url: [discordapp.com/api/webhooks/WEBHOOK_ID/WEBHOOK_TOKEN](discordapp.com/api/webhooks/WEBHOOK_ID/WEBHOOK_TOKEN)
    * `DevLogWebhookToken`: Optional. See above.

    * `RollReturns`: The multiplier return for each interval. For example, a value of `0, 2, 4, 10` with the intervals
      described above gives a 0x return for `random <= 66`, a 2x return for `66 < random <= 90`, a 4x return for
      `90 < random <= 99`, and a 10x return for `random == 100`.

## Testing functions
If you installed all dev dependencies, you can run tests with `poetry run pytest`.

## Running the bot
Run `poetry run python Main.py` in your shell. Ensure that your Discord token is set in the `config.ini` file within the `config` directory.
### Docker Container
A Docker Container is provided for easier development.
#### Building the Image
Freeze requirements to a requirements.txt

```
$ poetry export -f requirements.txt > requirements.txt
```

From within the root of the repository:

```
$ docker build -t canary:latest .
```

#### Running the Container
From within the root of the repository:

```
$ docker run -v $(pwd):/mnt/canary canary:latest
```

Optionally provide the `-d` flag to run the container in detached state.

Note that the current host directory is mounted into the container, any changes to log files, pickles, configuration are reflected
across the host and the container.

## Code Linting
We format our code using Google's [YAPF](https://github.com/google/yapf). Our builds will reject code that do not conform to the standards defined in [`.style.yapf`](https://github.com/idoneam/Canary/blob/master/.style.yapf) . You may format your code using :

```
$ poetry run yapf --recursive --in-place .
```
and ensure your code conforms to our linting with :
```
$ poetry run yapf --diff --recursive .
```
