# Written by @le-potate

# A "string with placeholders" is a simple string like
# "hi %user%, this is the channel %channel%", which
# contains placeholders, here %user% and %channel%
# (See the PString class docstring to see available placeholders.)

# A p-string is composed of a "string with placeholders",
# and values for these placeholders. Printing a p-string will
# fill the string with these values.

# This utility is mostly used in cases where messages have to be set
# from the server
# For a simple example, a moderator might want to set the goodbye message
# to be one of "bye @someone" or "ciao @someone". They would thus set the
# goodbye_message to "%[bye, ciao]% %user%" from the server.
# Then, when a user leaves,
# `await ctx.send(PString(goodbye_message, user=ctx.author.mention))`
# would be used, which will send "bye @someone" or "ciao @someone"

# Another, more complex use is groups placeholders, which is most often used
# as part of input/output patterns. For example, there could be
# a custom reaction that takes a prompt "I like %1%" and sends a response
# "I don't like %1%". Then, if someone writes "I like apples" in the server,
# "I don't like apples" would be sent. This is done by making a
# PStringEncodings object with a list of input "strings with placeholders"
# and a list of output "strings with placeholders" (see PStringEncodings
# docstring). Calling PStringEncodings.parser on the content of a message will
# then detect if the message corresponds to some input
# "strings with placeholders", choose a random one, and create a filled
# output p-string with its corresponding output "string with placeholders".
